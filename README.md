This repo contains files for a homework challenge I completed as part of the Algorithm Design and Analysis course from UPenn. I was tasked with creating two implementations of the kth_smallest algorithm. The first implementation uses mergesort to sort the list and extract the k-1 index. The second method uses quickSelect.
